# Resume Blog

This repo was made for a workshop for the MongoDB's Women In Computer Science Summit 2018.

Make your own resume website, with linked blog! 

* Use MongoDB Stitch (our "Backend As A Service") to allow people to add comments to your blog
    * Create a MongoDB Atlas Account, spin up a Cluster, and click "Link Stitch Application" 
    * Configure your application's backend on the Stitch Console
    * Edit blog-no-comments.html to work like blog-with-comments.html 
	* Copy and Paste your app-id from the Stitch console into the placeholder text "<your-app-id>"
* Are you done?
	* Try adding Email/Password Authentication
	* Add rules so users can edit their own comments
	* Set up Twilio integration so you receive texts when people comment on your post
	* Personalize resume.html with your own information, and style it with CSS / Javascript
